# clutter

> a word guessing game

[Play](https://olivermanzi.github.io/clutter/) :video_game:

## Game Rules

1. A correct guess is +1 point
2. An incorrect guess is -1 point
3. You have 60 seconds to guess as many times as you possibly can
4. Hints provides you with the final solution. The catch is that all the vowels are removed
5. You only have 5 hints
6. Restarting the game resets all acheivements

## Future Improvements

1. Scoreboard system
2. Interactive UI
3. Better Input Management
4. More categories for guessing (e.g. vine quotes, movies, music)
